***** TODO brief overview of other languages
****** TODO javascript, similaries - curly braces, web standard, poor library.
****** TODO java, less similar, very OO
****** TODO python, whitespace, minimalist
****** TODO C, memory management, speed
****** TODO clojure/haskell, just for the mind bend and to prove it exists
***** TODO game?

*** TODO get feedback from Lee
*** TODO decide on presentation/lesson format. Powerpoint? Markdown? Html?
*** TODO source enough laptops for everyone
*** TODO schedule first session!
    
* Lesson 1

** Course overview
*** teaching /programming/, not specific language
*** not scripting: good scripting IS programming
*** example-led
*** will change langauge so we don't get tied down
**** we should learn concepts, not keywords
**** good practices work in all langauges
*** by end: confident enough to tackle problems in any environment

** Aims
*** get quickly to coding, minimal overview
*** hello world
*** talk about logical controls, good practices
*** variables

** install lua
*** provide link
*** start installing

** what is scripting language
*** "dynamically typed"
**** fast to write, quick to modify
*** "interpreted"
**** type-load-run loop is quick
*** downsides: 
**** slow to execute
**** some errors found only at runtime

** why lua
*** few symbols 
**** no cury braces, ||, &&, etc
**** easy to read and format
*** concise language
*** dynamically typed and interpreted
*** easy to install
*** common language in industry
*** powerful features, eg tables, oo for later

** hello world

print ("hello world!")

*** that's it!
*** "function call" 
**** function is a collection of reusable code

*** "hello world" is a string
*** "parameter" to function 
**** data we want function to operate on

*** task: print the company name

** input/output

print("please enter your name:")
name = io.read()
print("hello " .. name .. "!")
   
*** line 2: "variable" storing "return value" from function
**** some functions return a result after operating on code
**** can store result in a variable
**** variable is storage of any type
***** a labeled box containing data
**** "io" is a library, or a collection of functions
**** in this case read() is returning your input

*** line 3: ".." stitches two strings together.
**** makes one big string
**** fetches string from name variable, stiches to both sides

*** task: also ask for, and print, the user's age in one line: "hello pete, age 20!"

** variables and equations

*** simple mathmatical equations work as normal
*** precedence important, brackets can override

** types
